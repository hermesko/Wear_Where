CLOTHING CONTENT SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS

- If you are choosing to use the java code template then skip this file and proceed
to the Wardrobe.java file. There are instructions and specifications in there.

- If you are filling out the myClothes.txt, please continue.

    Based on the weather, think about which of your clothes you'd wear during
    that temperature. Only consider the following temperature conditions of
        - Freezing
        - Chilly
        - Warm
        - Hot

    You define your gender in the first line of the file as either Male or Female
    and then begin filling out in between the brackets.
    When adding clothing items, capitalize the first letter of each word.
    You can use adjectives to help describe the clothing item you're inputting.
    Or you can include the brand name of the item if it makes a difference in their
    effectiveness during certain weather.

    Example: "Ripped Jeans"
* 			 "Baggy Sweatpants"
*            "Cashmere Sweater"
* 			 "Graphic Tee"
* 			 "Timberland Boots"
*			 "North Face Jacket"
*			 "Denim Jacket"

    Refrain from using color descriptions like: "Blue Shirt", "White Shirt"

    Also please don't add clothing items in the form of:
 * 		"Superbly Expensive Cashmere Sweater"
 * 		"My Favorite Pair of Nike's"
 * 		"Mom's Dress"
 * 		** No trolling. **

    You can also duplicate items in different temperature conditions if you wear that item
    in multiple conditions. So if you wear jeans in both chilly and freezing weather, you
    include it in both the chilly and freezing section.

    There will be a miscellaneous section in the file as well which you can fill out
    with things like gloves, scarves, fuzzy socks and etc. You can leave sections
    empty if you don't wear anything in that specific temperature condition.

 The format will be like the following example:

*           Gender: Male
*       Upper Body Wear
*    freezing
*    {
*    Canada Goose Coat
*    Trench Coat
*    }
*        chilly
*    {
*    North Face Jacket
*    Hoodie
*    Long Sleeve
*    }
*        warm
*    {
*    T-Shirt
*    Flannel Shirt
*    }
*        hot
*    {
*    Tank Top
*    }
*    --
*    --
*    and so on...


Each clothing item should be in its own line.

    Example:
        {
        T-Shirt
        Button Down Shirt
        Long Sleeve
        }


*** DO NOT CHANGE OR MOVE ANY OF THE BRACKETS OR WORDS AROUND. CHANGING THE LAYOUT WILL MAKE
 IT VERY DIFFICULT TO PARSE YOUR FILE SO PLEASE ONLY FILL IN CLOTHES IN BETWEEN THE
 BRACKETS !!! ***
