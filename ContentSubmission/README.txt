CLOTHING CONTENT SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS

****READ CAREFULLY!!! THERE ARE SOME VERY SPECIFIC STUFF FOR YOU TO KNOW BEFORE YOU BEGIN.****


    Based on the weather, think about which of your clothes you'd wear during
    that temperature. Only consider the following temperature conditions of
        - Freezing
        - Chilly
        - Warm
        - Hot
    Do not worry about conditions like rain/snow. We will account for those on our end.


    There's an upperbody, lowerbody, overall, and shoe section in the layout. Each section
    separates into freezing, chilly, warm, and hot brackets. You'll enter clothes that you think
    corresponds to that temperature. However you do not need to put all the layers of clothes into
    one bracket.

        For example: If it's freezing outside and you wear a shirt, sweater, and coat all layered up.
                    Do not put all three layers into the freezing section.

                    *As a rule enter the OUTERMOST layer only because it is usually the most important item.

                    In this case, the outermost layer is the coat.
                    It is assumed that if you put on a coat, then you're wearing layers under that coat
                    and you're not naked under it.
                    Refer to the example at the bottom of this README file.

             **EXCEPTIONS TO THE OUTERMOST LAYER RULE.
             If an article of clothing is specifically worn under your clothes like thermal
             leggings or undershirts, then please specify it and don't leave out that layer.


    There will be a miscellaneous section in the file as well which you can fill out
    with things like gloves, scarves, fuzzy socks and etc. You can leave sections
    empty if you don't wear anything in that specific temperature condition.

    You can also duplicate items in different temperature conditions if you wear that item
    in multiple conditions. So if you wear jeans in both chilly and freezing weather, you can
    include it in both the chilly and freezing section.

    Before you begin you define your gender in the first line of the file as either Male or Female
    and then start filling out in between the brackets.

    When adding clothing items, capitalize the first letter of each word.
    You can use adjectives to help describe the clothing item you're inputting.
    Or you can include the brand name of the item if it makes a difference in their
    effectiveness during certain weather.

    Example:    "Ripped Jeans"
* 			    "Baggy Sweatpants"
*               "Cashmere Sweater"
* 			    "Graphic Tee"
* 			    "Timberland Boots"
*			    "North Face Jacket"
*			    "Denim Jacket"

    Refrain from using color descriptions like: "Blue Shirt", "White Shirt"

    Also please don't add clothing items in the form of:
 * 		"Superbly Expensive Cashmere Sweater"
 * 		"My Favorite Pair of Nike's"
 * 		"Mom's Dress"
 * 		** No trolling. **


 The format of the myClothes.txt file will be like the following example:

*           Gender: Male
*       Upper Body Wear
*    freezing
*    {
*    Canada Goose Coat
*    Trench Coat
*    }
*        chilly
*    {
*    North Face Jacket
*    Hoodie
*    Long Sleeve
*    }
*        warm
*    {
*    T-Shirt
*    Flannel Shirt
*    }
*        hot
*    {
*    Tank Top
*    }
*    --
*    --
*    and so on...


Each clothing item should be in its own line.
You can add as many outfits as you'd like.

    Example:
        {
        T-Shirt
        Button Down Shirt
        Long Sleeve
        }


*** DO NOT CHANGE OR MOVE ANY OF THE BRACKETS OR WORDS AROUND. CHANGING THE LAYOUT WILL MAKE
 IT VERY DIFFICULT TO PARSE YOUR FILE SO PLEASE ONLY FILL IN CLOTHES IN BETWEEN THE
 BRACKETS !!! ***


 Your content is very important to us and helps us improve our application.
