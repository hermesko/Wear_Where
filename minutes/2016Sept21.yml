  Discussion:
    What would we want to do for this week of sprint 2?
      It is still to be determined in our own group meetings when we
      look more closely and find functions in each tab that do not work.

    Some form of progress must be presented week by week.

    If we have a function we expected to implement during a week but did not complete it
    during that week, we can push it to the next week and try to catch up. Function
    completion is not mandatory but progress and effort must be clearly shown.

  Task: Add more issues into github repository and assign them to group members.
